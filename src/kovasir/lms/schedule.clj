; Code Motion Algorithm:
;
; Compute the set L of top level statements for the current block, from a set
; of available statements E, a set of forced-inside statements G subset E and
; a block result R .
;
; 1. Start with L containing the known
; top level statements, initially the (available) block result R ∩ E .
;
; 2. Add to L all nodes reachable from L via normal links (neither hot nor
; cold) through E - G (not forced inside).
;
; 3. For each hot ref from L to a statement in E−L, follow any links through G,
; i.e. the nodes that are forced inside, if there are any. The first
; non-forced-inside nodes (the "hot fringe") become top level as well (add to
; L).
;
; 4. Continue with 2 until a fixpoint is reached.
